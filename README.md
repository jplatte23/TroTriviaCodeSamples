# TroTriviaCodeSamples
Code samples of code I wrote from TroTrivia for my portfolio. Scripts are in html, css, and java and js

### My role
I was responsible for implementing fullstack so I included some frontend and some backend.

### Files
 -  server.mjs: This code implements a real-time multiplayer quiz server using Node.js, Socket.IO, and MongoDB, supporting user authentication, game hosting, player joining, and live question answering.
 -  RegisterServlet.java - This Java class reads a JSON file to check if a user with the given username and password is already registered and returns their user ID if found.
 -  index.html/css - these files are the html and css files for the first page of the game where you can login, register, view profile, or enter a game pin and name and join a game.
